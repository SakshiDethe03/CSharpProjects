🚀 CsharpProjects – 200 C# Mini Projects Challenge

Welcome to my 200 C# Mini Projects Challenge 🎯

This repository documents my journey of building 200 C# mini projects to master C#, .NET, Object-Oriented Programming, and real-world problem solving.

The goal is simple:
👉 Build consistently
👉 Improve logic
👉 Strengthen OOP concepts
👉 Become industry-ready

📌 Challenge Goal

🏆 Total Projects Target: 200

🔥 Current Progress: 9 / 200

🎯 Focus: Fundamentals → OOP → LINQ → File Handling → Advanced Concepts → Real Applications

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: C#

Framework: .NET

IDE: Visual Studio

Application Type: Console Applications

📈 Why 200 Projects?

Because mastery doesn’t come from watching tutorials.
It comes from building consistently.

This challenge is about discipline, growth, and becoming confident in C# development.

🚀 Future Plan

Add Intermediate Projects (OOP-based systems)

Add File-based Mini Applications

Add GUI Applications

Add Small Real-World Simulations

📢 Progress Updates

I will keep updating this repository as I complete more projects.
